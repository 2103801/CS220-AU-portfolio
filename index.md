Hello! My name is Ayomide Oyedele, aka Ayo. 

I am a first year student, studying Global studies with business management at the University of Essex. Alongside my studies, I have a part time job which I use to support myself financially. I have also been teaching music technology-related subjects (e.g. sonic art, sensor technology and music for the moving image) as an associate lecturer at the Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge and the University of Bedfordshire and currently teach a module on sensemaking and digital identities at the School of Philosophy and Arts History at the University of Essex. As a freelancer and artist, I have been producing sound design and music, websites and visual art, including photography and paintings.
